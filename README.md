# Sass Prof

[![Gem](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/sass-prof.svg?style=flat-square)](https://rubygems.org/gems/sass-prof)

Sass Prof is a code profiler for Sass. For each function, Sass Prof will show the execution time for the function, which file called it and what arguments were given when the function was called.

## Requirements

* Sass ~> `3.4.0`

## Installation

1. Install with `gem install sass-prof`
2. If you're using Compass, add `require "sass-prof"` to your `config.rb`
3. Sass Prof will automatically run next time you compile
4. That's it!

## Uninstall
1. Remove the line `require "sass-prof"` from your `config.rb`

## Usage
You may specify a few options within your `config.rb`, such as directing output to a log file.

```ruby
require "sass-prof"

# Instance of Sass::Prof's configuration
prof = Sass::Prof::Config

# Available options
prof.output_file = "sass-prof.log" # Default is `false`
prof.t_max       = 500             # Default is `100`
prof.color       = true            # Default is `true`
```
